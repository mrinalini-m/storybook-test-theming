So far, there hasn't been documentation on how to change the background color of the canvas with storybook toolbar theming controls. The `storybook-dark-mode` branch of this repo uses the [storybook-dark-mode package](https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/storybook-dark-mode) to demo this.

Make sure to add the package to addons in `.storybook/main.js` and
take a look at `.storybook/preview.tsx` to see the code.

This library was bootstrapped with [TSDX](https://github.com/formium/tsdx).

## Usage

After cloning the repo, run `npm run install`. Then run `npm run storybook`.
